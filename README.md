# The College Hub

## Problem Statement

MANIT is a large college with numerous events happening throughout the year. However, many of these events often go unnoticed by students, even when they are important. This lack of awareness is a common pain point for students at the college.

## Solution

"The College Hub" is a project designed to address this issue. It serves as a centralized platform for all news and events within the college. The primary goal is to keep students and users well-informed about campus activities and occurrences.

In summary, "The College Hub" is a comprehensive college news and event platform that:

- Aggregates information about events, news, and important updates within the college.
- Ensures that students and users stay up-to-date with campus activities.
- Helps bridge the gap between the college community and the events that matter to them.
